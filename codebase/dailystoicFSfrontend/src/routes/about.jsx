                    Memento mori is a Latin phrase that means "remember that you must die." It is a
                    reminder to focus on the present and to make the most of one's time, as death is
                    inevitable. This website is dedicated to providing daily inspiration and
                    guidance from the ancient philosophy of Stoicism. The goal is to help you
                    navigate the challenges of modern life by sharing the wisdom of the Stoics, who
                    believed in the power of self-control and the ability to rise above adversity.
